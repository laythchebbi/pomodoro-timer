Focus on the process, not the outcome.
One thing at a time.
You're capable of amazing things.
Small progress is still progress.
Stay curious, stay focused.
The only way out is through.

Take a moment to breathe.
You deserve this rest.
Stretch and smile!
Clear mind, fresh start.
Recharge your batteries.
Good things take time.
