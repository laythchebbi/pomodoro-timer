The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.
Focus on being productive instead of busy.
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
It's not about having time, it's about making time.
Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Your focus determines your reality.
Action is the foundational key to all success.
Discipline is choosing between what you want now and what you want most.
The harder you work for something, the greater you'll feel when you achieve it.
Dreams don't work unless you do.
Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.
Great things never come from comfort zones.
Work hard in silence, let success make the noise.
Stay focused, go after your dreams and keep moving toward your goals.
The future depends on what you do today.
Done is better than perfect.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
